       <h3>Here's a timeline of Kobe's life:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Born August 23, 1978 Kobe Bean Bryant better known as Kobe Bryant was an American professional basketball player.</li>
            <li>Kobe who is dubbed “Black Mamba” is best known for leading the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball
                Association
                (NBA) to five championships (2000–02 and 2009–10).</li>
            <li>Bryant opted to forgo college and declared himself eligible for the NBA draft when he graduated from high school. The
            Charlotte Hornets chose him with the 13th pick of the 1996 draft.</li>
            <li>He was traded to the Lakers and became the second youngest NBA player in history when the 1996–97 season opened.</li>
            <li>He quickly proved his merit with the Lakers and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game in just his second season,
            becoming the youngest All-Star.</li>
            <li>Bryant was forced to share the role of the Lakers’ star player with his popular and talented teammate Shaquille O’Neal.</li>
            <li>Despite winning five titles during a string of dominance throughout the 2000s, Bryant only garnered one NBA Most
            Valuable Player award during his career — in 2008.</li>
            <li>In 2002 Kobe Bryant paid $8 million to get out of his endorsement contract with Adidas so that he could sign with Nike.</li>
            <li>In 2003, only 2 years after marrying his wife Vanessa, Kobe was charged with sexual assault against a 19-year-old hotel
            employee. The case was dismissed but he settled a civil suit out of court.</li>
            <li>Bryant also succeeded on the international stage via Olympic gold medals for basketball in 2008, and in 2012.</li>
            <li>The veteran All-Star surpassed Michael Jordan for third all-time on the NBA scoring list in December 2014,</li>
            <li>In 2015 it was reported that Kobe Bryant earned $49.5 million, between his NBA contract and endorsement deals with
            various companies.</li>
            <li>In 2015 Bryant wrote the poem “Dear Basketball,” and two years later it served as the basis for a short film of the same
            name, which he also narrated. The work won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.</li>
            <li>In 2018 Bryant published the book The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, in which he described his approach to basketball; the
            title reflected a nickname he bestowed upon himself during his playing days, “The Black Mamba.”</li>
            <li>Bryant scored 60 points or more six different times throughout his career – including the unbelievable showing in his
            final NBA game.</li>
            <li>Kobe Bryant earned over $328 million from his NBA contracts during his career. He is believed to have made over $680
            million in total during his career from his NBA salary and endorsements.</li>
            <li>The NBA legend died in a tragic helicopter crash yesterday, January 26, 2020, alongside his 13-year-old daughter Gianna
            as well as eight other persons aboard.</li>
